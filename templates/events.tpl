<h4>WICS Basic Programming Workshop</h4>
<p>The University of Arizona Women in Computer Science (WICS) will be hosting
a programming seminar for those interested in diving into Python, Matlab, and
more. There are volunteering opportunities as well as the chance to learn
something new.</p>
<h5>Python Intro</h5>
<p>Learn Python from scratch, from the download to arithmetic to variables 
to loops to file IO. This is the same as the Intro Python workshop offered 
on March 4. Installation and snacks: 12:00-12:15pm. Class: 12:15-1:15pm.</p>

<h5>Applying Python</h5>
<p>In this workshop, we will dive a little deeper into Python, and also 
apply it to solve a real-world scientific task. Lists, dictionaries, more 
advanced loops, and more practice problems, including parsing a file and 
probably an alternative task if you hate file parsing. Class: 1:30-2:30pm.</p>

<h5>MATLAB Intro</h5>
<p>Loaded with features, MATLAB makes number crunching quick and easy to 
visualize. Used extensively in many industries, from engineering to computer 
vision. Learn MATLAB from scratch, including the development environment, 
(array) variables, loops, scripts, and many built-in functions.
Installation, if needed: 3:00-3:30pm.
MATLAB basics: 3:30-5:00pm</p>

<h4>2nd Annual Spring Programming Competition</h4>
<p>The Spring 2012 programming competition has yet to be determined, but talks have started addressing the topic and style of the 2<sup>nd</sup> annual "University of Arizona ACM Spring Programming Competition".</p>
<p>The previous year's competition was in the style of ICPC without the language limitations, but there have been recent suggestions to create a single project that teams can hack on. We expect to finalize the competition details, sponsors, and date within the month.</p>
