<h4>2nd Annual Spring Programming Competition</h4>
<p>The Spring 2012 programming competition has yet to be determined, but talks have started addressing the topic and style of the 2<sup>nd</sup> annual "University of Arizona ACM Spring Programming Competition".</p>
<p>The previous year's competition was in the style of ICPC without the language limitations, but there have been recent suggestions to create a single project that teams can hack on. We expect to finalize the competition details, sponsors, and date within the month.</p>
