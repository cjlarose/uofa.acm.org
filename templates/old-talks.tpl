  <h4>An Introduction to Monads<em>(Chris Van Horne)</em></h4>
  <p>
  Continuing from the "Haskell in 15 Minutes" talk from last week,
  Chris will cover monads and remove some of their mystique. The talk
  will give the rationale of monads in a pure lazy functional
  language like Haskell. The Wadler interpreter will be the vehicle
  of discovery for derivation of two standard Haskell monads: 
  <code>Maybe</code> and 
  <code>Writer</code>. This talk should be considered
  advanced, but the high-level concepts appropriate for a 200-level CSc student. <a href='static/talks/monads-acm-spring12.pdf'>Download this PDF.</a></p>

  <p>An introduction to version control with git, covering what version control
