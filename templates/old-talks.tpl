  <h4>An Introduction to Monads<em>(Chris Van Horne)</em></h4>
  <p>
  Continuing from the "Haskell in 15 Minutes" talk from last week,
  Chris will cover monads and remove some of their mystique. The talk
  will give the rationale of monads in a pure lazy functional
  language like Haskell. The Wadler interpreter will be the vehicle
  of discovery for derivation of two standard Haskell monads: 
  <code>Maybe</code> and 
  <code>Writer</code>. This talk should be considered
  advanced, but the high-level concepts appropriate for a 200-level CSc student. <a href='static/talks/monads-acm-spring12.pdf'>Download this PDF.</a></p>

  <h4>Git: rm *.old <em>(Chas Leichner)</em></h4>
  <p>An introduction to version control with git, covering what version control
  is and why we use it, how to do basic operations with git, how to use git to
  collaborate with others, and the basics of github.
